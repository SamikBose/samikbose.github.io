## About

I am an Assistant Professor working in the Department of Computational Mathematics Science and Engineering at the Michigan State University. I have been teaching various undergraduate and graduate level courses since joining the department e.g., Computational Medicine, Linear Algebra and Matrix Applications, Machine Learning in Molecular Dynamics and Independent Research Study coursework. 
I am also continuing my postdoctoral research under the mentorship of Prof. Alex Dickson (Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Michigan State University) in Computational Biophysics and Pharmacology. 
In future, as an independent faculty, my goal is to combine the complementary strengths of machine learning and theoretical physical chemistry to develop computational methods for pharmacologically relevant processes, augmenting the biomedical/health research by molecular modeling. With my expertise in theoretical chemistry along with endeavors and interest in drug discovery, I hope to provide molecular bases in in solving critical problems related to 'Human Health and Biology'. Hence, I aim to collaborate and enhance the synergy between experiment and computation, utilizing facilities like cryo-EM, NMR, mass spec etc. Currently, I am collaborating actively with experimental scientists across medicinal chemistry (Prof. V. T. Karamyan, Oakland University), cryo-EM/structural biology (Dr. B. J. Orlando, Michigan State University), pharmacology (Dr. K. S. S. Lee, Michigan State University), and biochemistry/structural biology (A. A. Pioszak, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center). Continuous endeavors with these research groups at the interface of chemistry, biology and medicine have enlightened me about the current requirement of molecular modeling tools that will enhance the scientific community.
